# FaceFact

**FaceFact** is a SwiftUI application designed to help users remember the people they meet by allowing them to store a photo and details about where and how they know each person. This app was built as a learning project and is my first Swift app.

## ✨ Features

- 📸 **Photo Selection**: Use the system PhotoPicker to select a picture of the person directly from your device.
- 📝 **Note Important Details**: Save contextual information like where you met them and how you know them.
- 💾 **Local Data Storage**: Uses SwiftData to persist information on the local device.
- 🔍 **Clean SwiftUI Interface**: Built entirely with SwiftUI for a smooth and modern user experience.
